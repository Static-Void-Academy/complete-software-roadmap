# The Complete Software Roadmap & Checklist
## by Static Void Academy

A giant roadmap and visual checklist for software engineering concepts. What did we miss? Have any feedback? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Static-Void-Academy/complete-software-roadmap/issues) or feel free to open a PR according to [guidelines below](#contributing).

To view this graphic in its entirety, check it out on the [Static Void Academy's website](https://staticvoid.dev/roadmap).

## Contributing

1. This roadmap is constructed using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a fantastic freeware app for drawing diagrams in a hand-drawn style.
2. Before doing anything, open an issue describing what changes you want to make so we can keep an electronic trail. You're welcome to start working before anyone responds to your issue, but keep in mind that if your issue is rejected, your PR will be rejected too.
3. Then fork and clone this repository.
4. Open [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) in your web browser, and then open `sva-roadmap.excalidraw` in it. Make the changes you need to.
5. When you are done, do two things:
  1. Make sure you save the roadmap back to the same file (`sva-roadmap.excalidraw`).
  2. Export your roadmap (with your changes) as SVG at 2x to `sva-roadmap.svg`. To do so, click the document icon with arrow, click on "2x" on the bottom right, then click "SVG" on the bottom left. Overwrite `sva-roadmap.svg` that's in the repository.
6. Commit, push, and open a PR describing your changes. Someone will respond when available.
